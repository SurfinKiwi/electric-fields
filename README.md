Open the code: Open the index.html file in an IDE (VSCode) 
Adjust the Number of Pieces:

Use the slider to change the number of pieces the rod is divided into.
The app will automatically update the electric field value and redraw the diagrams.
See the Results:

The electric field value will update based on the number of pieces.
You will see two types of diagrams: one for the adjustable number of pieces and two fixed diagrams for 100 and 1000 pieces.

The code uses the Coulomb's law and integrates over the length of the rod to find the electric field at a point.
